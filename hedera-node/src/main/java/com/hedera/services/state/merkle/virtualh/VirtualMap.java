/**
 * A map-like Merkle node designed for working with huge numbers of key/value pairs stored primarily
 * in off-heap memory mapped files and pulled on-heap only as needed. It buffers changes locally and
 * flushes them to storage on {@link #release()}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code VirtualMap} is created with a {@link VirtualDataSource}. The {@code VirtualDataSource} is
 * used by the map to read/write data to/from disk. This interface has only one practical implementation
 * in this code base, the {@link com.hedera.services.state.merkle.virtualh.persistence.mmap.MemMapDataSource},
 * which is backed by memory-mapped files. Several in-memory data source implementations exist for testing
 * purposes. The API of the data source is closely tied to the needs of the {@code VirtualMap}. This was done
 * intentionally to <strong>reduce temporary objects and misalignment of the API to enhance performance.</strong>.
 * The {@code VirtualDataSource} exists as an implementation interface of the {@code VirtualMap} and is unsuited
 * for generic use.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code VirtualMap} buffers changes in memory and only flushes them to the {@code VirtualDataSource} on
 * {@link #release()}. The release should happen in a background thread and not as part of {@code handleTransaction}.
 * This map <strong>does not accept null keys</strong> but does accept null values.</p>
 *
 * TODO: Right now the implementation will break if commit is called on a background thread. This needs to be fixed.
 *
 * <p>The {@code VirtualMap} is {@code FastCopyable} and should be used in a similar manner to any other normal
 * Swirlds MerkleNode. The {@code VirtualMap} does have some runtime overhead, such as caches, which require
 * size relative to the number of <strong>dirty leaves</strong> in the map, not relative to the number of values
 * read or the number of items in the backing store. On {@code release} these changes are flushed to disk and
 * the caches are cleared. Thus, a node in the Merkle tree that had a VirtualMap has very little overhead when
 * not in use, and very little overhead after release, and reasonable overhead when in use for reasonable-sized
 * changes.</p>
 *
 * TODO: The implementation needs to be made to work with reconnect. There are serialization methods to attend to.
 * TODO: The implementation needs to be integrated into the normal Merkle commit mechanism
 * TODO: The implementation needs to prove out the integration of hashing with how the Merkle tree normally hashes.
 * TODO: I'm not sure how the datasource can be serialized and restored, or how that works.
